## Log

### R2D2 - 20201117
Lingilearn. Python. Spent today refactoring and improving my `/word` endpoints and external API functions. Mainly I converted my conditional returns from the external API functions to raise exceptions if there is a problem, and then handling them in the context of the in-house API with `try` and `except` statemnts. Getting comfortable with exception hanlding in Python and seeing the value in it. Much less spaghetti `if-else` statements.

### R2D1 - 20201116
Linguilearn. I'm comfortably using map() with reactjs and understand what it is doing better. Added lots more word details to search results and am displaying it nicely in my component.
