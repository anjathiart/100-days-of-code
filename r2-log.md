### R2D5 2020-11-20

### R2D4 2020-11-19
Linguilearn. Again, debuggin my API in the browser. Would be slightly less bad if I saved search results to local storage so that I wouldn't have to wait for WordAPI requests so long. Must. Write. Tests. Today I spent time on handling UI/UX/API for saving a new entry with details. Understanding the ...spread operator all of a sudden. And also learnt how to update a nested React state object. It feels like having to do things in a certain way to get things to update correctly is more clear using React Classes without all the other add-ons (like Vuex, Vue Router equivilants).

### R2D3 2020-11-18
Linguilearn. Finding myself testing in the browser instead of just writing more tests :(
Added error / warning message display to the UI and fixed related backend bugs. Need to read up more on python ValueErrors, because I'm using them, converting them to ints, and comparing but I don't know how to access the 'object' (is it an object?)
Also working on the next UI view (filling in personalized details for an entry)

### R2D2 - 2020-11-17
Lingilearn. Python. Spent today refactoring and improving my `/word` endpoints and external API functions. Mainly I converted my conditional returns from the external API functions to raise exceptions if there is a problem, and then handling them in the context of the in-house API with `try` and `except` statemnts. Getting comfortable with exception hanlding in Python and seeing the value in it. Much less spaghetti `if-else` statements.

### R2D1 - 2020-11-16
Linguilearn. I'm comfortably using map() with reactjs and understand what it is doing better. Added lots more word details to search results and am displaying it nicely in my component.
