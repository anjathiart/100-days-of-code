# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1 - Anja Thiart

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on 2 August 2020

## Initial goal
I want to complete CS50 Web, the follow up to CS50 Computer Science. 
In parrallel to the above, I want to develop my personal website and incorporate my projects from the course, as well as the preceding course, as I go along.

## Log

### R1D1 - 20200802
My first day. I created this repo. I updated the last project I worked on's repo (called Taper Journey) and found the video I made demonstrating it and added that to the repo. Also pushed psets from that course (CS50 Intro...) to a private repo.

### R1D2 - 20200803
Watched CS50W lecture 1 (HTML, CSS) and 2 (GIT). Started with project 0 creating the home page (normal search) of a google search frontend / clone. The css will be reusable on each page.

### R1D3 - 20200804
I worked on project 0 on the image search and advanced search pages. I learnt that the name of a form input becomes the query paramater keys (don't know how I didn't know that before). Functionality is complete. I did have to use some javascript for the google "I'm feeling lucky" search clone (not sure if this was intended for the project). Now I have some styling left and the screencast.

### R1D4 - 20200805
Today I completec coding up the google clone frontend. I was reminded that I often read over things too quickly, since on second reading over the project brief, they actually make it clear that the 'name' attributes become the query parameters. I have submitted the code to Submit50 but still need to make the video and fill the form.

### R1D04 - 20200806
Submitted the YouTube video of Project 0 and everything (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05eHUQ03eMA&feature=youtu.be). I learnt how to timestamp youtube vids. I also watched the Python lecture. Was reminded of decorators and how I can see it functioning as middleware. Looks like we'll be using OOP as well which I need to touch up on.

### R1D05 - 20200807
Added my google search clone to my github account https://github.com/anjathiart/google-search-clone. Watched the lecture on Django. Python-Django is totally different to what I'm used to using Node-Vue. But as I follow along I can tell how the one method relates to the methods used at work. It's a new way of thinking about it which is good. The tooling / configuration / structure of a python-django app is a mindset shift for me.

### R1D06 - 20200808
Started Project 1: Wiki (CS50W). I'm getting used to the Django frontend and folder structure. I'm confused with the "not namespaced" error I get as I believe that I am implementing things namespaced. I'm sure it will make sense later on. I've implemented a dynamic route for viewing entries, as well as an error page for 404 not found.

### R1D07 - 20200809
Continued with my wiki. I'm struggling a bit with the django-python syntax but getting there. I spent quite some time on some pretty obvious bugs. My search route is working and displaying correctly now. I'm also feeling more comfortable with render vs redirect. I have also learnt that changes to my css does not automatically get registered and for that, I must bypass the cache with a hard refresh. This is not the case with Vue.
