## Log

### R1D1 - 20200802
My first day. I created this repo. I updated the last project I worked on's repo (called Taper Journey) and found the video I made demonstrating it and added that to the repo. Also pushed psets from that course (CS50 Intro...) to a private repo.

### R1D2 - 20200803
Watched CS50W lecture 1 (HTML, CSS) and 2 (GIT). Started with project 0 creating the home page (normal search) of a google search frontend / clone. The css will be reusable on each page.

### R1D3 - 20200804
I worked on project 0 on the image search and advanced search pages. I learnt that the name of a form input becomes the query paramater keys (don't know how I didn't know that before). Functionality is complete. I did have to use some javascript for the google "I'm feeling lucky" search clone (not sure if this was intended for the project). Now I have some styling left and the screencast
